# Diver Summary Page (v3)
- Fixes for name not appearing (broader matching of user id fields; optional ?name= override).
- Adds visible debug line to show which bonus endpoint returned data (or which were tried).
- Same compact thumbnails, fish points per claim, bonus list + total, top total score.

Use:
  /diver.html?user_id=<UUID>&name=<Display Name>&score=<Score>   (name/score optional)

Place the `public/` folder contents into your project's `public/` folder.
